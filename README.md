# Example of how to use Google-Earth-Engine-API with Python 
This repo contains some examples of how to use the Google-Earth-Engine-API (GEE-API) with a pipenv python environment. 

## Usage 
You can clone this repo in a terminal by typing 

                C:\Users\SuI\Documents\code\>git clone https://ngi001@dev.azure.com/ngi001/NGI/_git/google-earth-engine-API-example

Change into the new directory 

            C:\Users\SuI\Documents\code\> cd google-earth-engine-API-example     

and strat a vritual environment from the command line 

        C:\Users\SuI\Documents\code\google-earth-engine-API-example> pipenv shell 
        Launching subshell in virtual environment...

First time you use the code in this repo you need to install the dependencies of the virtual environment 

        (google-earth-engine-API-example-jOx4Q0kO-shims) C:\Users\SuI\Documents\code\google-earth-engine-API-example> pipenv install 

Then you can either run the [notebook through VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/notebooks) or through your browser by the command 

            (google-earth-engine-API-example-jOx4Q0kO-shims) C:\Users\SuI\Documents\code\google-earth-engine-API-example> jupyter-lab
